# TODO: I think this would be very useful, but it's not currently supported

# an overrides.yml file at the base of the project can be used as shown below.

notes:
  Joe Smith: >
    Grade is shown for feedback only, but it was excused in the
    gradebook, since you were virtual learning for much of the project
  Johnny Appleseed: >
    In the gradebook, you got an 85, because I made deductions less
    significant. Thank you for outstanding effort on your do-nows


# overrides can apply to a specific assignment, or an overall grade.
